The FIR filters are named the following way:

psi_fix_fir_<decimation>_<calculation-handling>_<channels>_<channel-handling>_<coefficient-handling>_<architecture>

<decimation>
dec		Decimating FIR filter
-		If omitted, the filter cannot decimate

<calculation-handling>
ser		Serial calculation (one multiplier calculates one tap after the other)
par		Parallel calculation (one multiplier per tap is used, one sample per clock cycle can be processed)
semi		Everything between

<channels>
nch		Multi-channel (channel count configurable)
1ch		Single-channel

<channel-handling>
par		All channels arrive in parallel and can be calculated in parallel
tdm		Channels are calculated one after the other

<coefficient-handling>
conf		Coefficients can be written, all channels use the same cofficients
fix		Coefficients are fixed, all channels use the same coefficients
confch		Same as conf but different coefficients per channel
fixch		Same as fix but different coefficients per channel		

<architecture>
x7		Xilinx seven series
-		If omitted, the implementation is not architecture specific
