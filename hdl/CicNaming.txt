The CIC filters are named the following way:

psi_fix_cic_<int/dec>_<ratio-handling>_<channels>_<input-handling>_<output-handling>_<architecture>

<ratio-handling>
fix		Ratio is compile-time defined
cfg		Ratio is configurable

<int/dec>
int		Interpolating CIC
dec		Decimating CIC

<channels>
nch		Multi-channel (channel count configurable)
1ch		Single-channel

<input-handling>
par		Channels are taken in in parallel
tdm		Channels are taken in in TDM mode
-		Omitted for single channel implementations

<output-handling>
par		Channels are output in parallel
tdm		Channels are output in TDM mode	
-		Omitted for single channel implementations

<architecture>
x7		Xilinx seven series
-		If omitted, the implementation is not architecture specific
