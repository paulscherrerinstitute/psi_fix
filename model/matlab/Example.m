% Note that this example only shows how to call the python models from 
% MATLAB. Details on how the pythons model work need to be checked in the
% python code.

% Important note: After changing python models, MATLAB must be restarted
% to reload the new python models. Therefore it is suggested to develop
% the models in python and use MATLAB only as additional interface.

%Python call syntax: py.<file>.<class>.<Method>([parameters])
